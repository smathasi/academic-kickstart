I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Statistics at Northwestern University, under the guidance of [Dr. Larry Hedges](https://statistics.northwestern.edu/people/faculty/larry-hedges.html).
My research involves developing statistical methods for program evaluation in the social sciences, with a focus on methods for studying replication and treatment effect heterogeneity.

Before graduate school, I worked as a data analyst for Pittsburgh Public Schools where I developed a passion for education research and policy. Since then, I have continued my interdisciplinary training as a Pre-doctoral Fellow in the Institute of Education Sciences [multi-disciplinary training program](https://www.mpes.sesp.northwestern.edu/), a graduate research assistant at the [Institute for Policy Research](https://www.ipr.northwestern.edu/), and a member of the 
[Statistics for Evidence-Based Policy and Practice (STEPP) Center Lab](https://stepp.center/).

I love what I do, but there's more to life than statistics! I believe in leaving things better than I found them and am committed to improving my community. Among other things, I have served as the President of the [Northwestern Graduate Leadership & Advocacy Council](https://sites.northwestern.edu/glac/) and co-founded [CoalitionNU](https://twitter.com/gradcoalitionNU), a graduate student organization focused on improving the experiences of scholars from historically excluded backgrounds. These days, I'm working with the [Society for Research and Educational Effectiveness](https://www.sree.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=175:nov-dec-2019-newsletter&catid=20:site-content) on creating additional supports for researchers of color.

When I'm not doing research or trying to change systems, I enjoy practicing yoga, reading, and indulging my unabashed love for reality television.
